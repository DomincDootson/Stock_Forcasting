# Future Stock Prediction
In this file we develop different models to predict the future perforamnce of stocks given previous data about 
them. We consider the following models:

1. ARIMA
2. PROPHET
3. LSTM 

We study how good each of these models  are in the jupyter notebook, using historic Apple stock data. We then train 
models for a variety of stocks, so that we can impliment a simple trend following strategy.
